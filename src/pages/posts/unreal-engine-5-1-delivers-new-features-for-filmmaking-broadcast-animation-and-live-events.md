# 🧠 Introducing Terry’s 2048 Game: A Personal Project

I'm excited to share my latest project: a fully functional 2048 game built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. This game is a personal endeavour to recreate the classic 2048 puzzle game, offering a seamless and engaging experience.

## 🎮 What Is 2048?

2048 is a popular single-player puzzle game where the objective is to combine numbered tiles on a 4×4 grid to create a tile with the number 2048. Players slide tiles in four directions (up, down, left, right), merging matching numbers to form higher values. The game ends when no more valid moves are possible.

## 🔧 How It Works

The game is developed using React, TypeScript, and Vite, ensuring compatibility across modern browsers. Here's a brief overview of the core components:

- **React**: Manages the user interface and game state.
- **TypeScript**: Provides static typing for better code quality and maintainability.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool that enhances development speed and experience.

## 🚀 Features

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Smooth Animations**: Enjoy fluid tile movements and merges.
- **Undo Functionality**: Go back one step to correct mistakes.
- **Restart Option**: Start a new game at any time.
